# Overview

## Results:
 
Some things that had were glaringly issues was the eligible mentors and the fact they dont equate to the amount of retiring people. [ 2 screenshots here]

* A total of 72,458 people are retiring 

* A total of 10,095 are eligble mentors

* A significant loss of engineers, senior staff, and combinations of the two will results in a large gap to fill even with the available mentors

* Mentors would need to take on entire classrooms of people in order to get new employees up to speed

##Summary

The silver tsunami that hits HP will wash away a little more than 72,000 employees in the coming years.  This is a significant impact to the work force of the company especially seeing as how the roles being impacted have significant weigt in the company. 18,110 Engineers, 16,370 Senior Staff, 16,193 Staff, and 15,839 Senior Engineers is a large hit to the company. Not to mention 3602 Technique Leaders and 2342 Assistant Engineers along with 2 managers. Almost all of these roles will need to be filled in the time after that tsunami hits.

A glaring issue for this exodus of employees is the lack of mentors that are available. Unless said mentors want to take on classroom sized groups of new employees to teach there is no way that the current employees could mentor enough people to fill the oncoming vacancies.
